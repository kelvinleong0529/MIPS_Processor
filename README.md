# MIPS_Processor

This project aims to simulate the internal functions of a multi-cycle 32-bits pipelined MIPS processor, in order to trace the signals through the CPU cycle and illustrate how an instruction is executed.

By animating the flow of data within the CPU architecture, this simulator provides a more intuitive understanding of how the CPU **FETCHS**, **DECODES**, and **EXECUTES** instructions.
