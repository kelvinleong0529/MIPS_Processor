# MIPS_Processor

This project aims to simulate the internal functions of a multi-cycle 32-bits pipelined MIPS processor, in order to trace the signals through the CPU and illustrate how an instruction is executed.

By animating the flow of data within the CPU, the simulator provides us with a more intuitive understanding of how the CPU fetches, decodes, and executes instructions.
